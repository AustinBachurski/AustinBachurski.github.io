                <p>
                I began my self-taught journey into programming in January 2021, 
                starting with C++ and expanding into Python, C#, SQL, C, and 
                JavaScript. This followed a successful 18-year career in the 
                automotive field, where I spent 4 years as a supervisor and 14
                years as a mechanic. For the last 1.5 years I have been
                applying my problem-solving skills in a GIS role. My goal is
                to transition into a programming career within the next year.
                I still have a lot to learn, but I'm as driven as they come 
                and I've yet to find something I couldn't become good at if 
                I set my mind to it.
                <br><br>
                C++ has been my primary focus as I am drawn to the complexity 
                and control that the language offers. After getting a solid 
                grasp on the fundamentals, I began adding more "tools to the 
                toolbox" starting with Python. My move to a GIS role provided 
                numerous opportunities for automating repetitive data entry
                and mapping tasks, which allowed me to learn and work with SQL 
                via our GIS database. I find myself writing at least one simple 
                script each week to make my workflows more efficient. After 
                running into limitations in speed and portability with Python, 
                I returned my focus to C++.  I'll never forget seeing the 
                speed increase for the first time, I thought it didn't work at 
                all because the window closed so fast, then I checked the 
                output file... I'm pretty sure that's when I got bit by the 
                performance bug, I love making things faster and more efficient.  
                <br><br>
                After acquiring a C++ Nanodegree from Udacity and getting a few 
                projects under my belt, I took several courses in C#, SQL, C, 
                and JavaScript to broaden my skillset and expose me to 
                additional ways of solving problems. My almost two decades of 
                mechanical diagnosis and repair have given me a "can do" 
                attitude and a unique view to problem solving. Vehicles and 
                equipment now a days are pretty much computers with wheels and
                electrical diagnosis was my specialty throughout my previous 
                career, maybe someday I'll pursue a career in embedded systems
                and "return to my roots" in the automotive field.  For now, I
                look forward to learning everything I can about software and 
                systems and honing a new set of skills. It's been a journey 
                already, but I'm just getting started.
                <br> <br>
                My wife and I had our first child, a baby boy, in December of 
                2022, so he takes up most of our free time.  When I do get a 
                chance to get away, I enjoy PC gaming, going to see movies with 
                my wife, and weekend barbeques with friends and family.

                    - City of Kalispell, MT (July 2022 - Present)
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Developed a Portal Services Controller tool using 
                            C++ and wxWidgets. The tool is used across our 
                            department and makes everyone’s job faster and 
                            easier, moving service control time from a manual 
                            process taking 5 to 10 minutes, to a two-click 
                            automated process requiring less than 2 minutes 
                            to complete.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Developed a command line utility using C++ and an 
                            embedded Python environment to fully automate our 
                            SQL database maintenance. This removed the need for 
                            human intervention other than reading a brief event 
                            log, which is conveniently emailed to GIS staff each 
                            week.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Developed a simple, step-by-step Crime Map Wizard 
                            tool for our Police Department using C++ and 
                            wxWidgets. Eliminating repetitive copy/paste work 
                            which had previously led to frustration and 
                            departure of the volunteers who perform this work.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Automated a large portion of my daily workflow by 
                            developing a C# tool with a WinForms UI. This tool 
                            calls our Cityworks API to retrieve data and assist 
                            in filtering/inserting the data to a spreadsheet.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Wrote another small utility with C++ and wxWidgets 
                            for our Building department that quickly parsed out 
                            annual report data from a spreadsheet instead of 
                            them having to do so manually.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Tailored our Cityworks asset management web 
                            interface and database backend using TypeScript and 
                            XML to suit the needs of our fleet facility as they 
                            migrated to the platform. Migration to Cityworks 
                            allowed the organization to retire the previous 
                            asset management service that was only used for 
                            fleet, saving $900 per year on unneeded subscription 
                            costs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Debugged a large Python script written by a previous 
                            employee that had failed after a network update, 
                            the script was published as a web tool to our GIS 
                            Enterprise portal as a tool, which added a layer of 
                            complexity to troubleshooting.

                            compensation incentives to employees who achieved

                        context menu and selectable text frame. Users can start 
                        or stop all services at once with a couple clicks of 
                        the top menu bar, allowing server maintenance tasks or

                        but I did learn a lot in the process of developing this 
                        tool. For my first decent project I'm pleased with the 
                        way the tool functions, and it did solve the problem I 
                        set out to solve, so I suppose I can't complain.

                        This tool was written to help the volunteers at the 
                        Kalispell Police Department update the Kalispell Crime 
                        Heatmap quickly and easily, no more copy/pasting in

                        Crime Map Wizard is a newer version of the Crime Map 
                        Update Assistant that provides a graphical wizard with 
                        the previous three geoprocessing scripts improved and 
                        condensed into a single script. The user interface and 
                        Excel parser is written in C++ using wxWidgets, and the 
                        geoprocessing script is written in Python using the 
                        ArcGIS ArcPy module.

                        Quite a simple little application, its purpose wat to
                        make life easier on the Police Department volunteer who
                        performs the weekly work to update the Kalispell Crime
                        Map. Previously it was seven Excel sheets of copy/paste
                        before manually converting the .csv to GIS data and 
                        uploading the data to a web map. The volunteers are
                        generally retired officers or military and may not be
                        proficient with computers. The tool was made to be as
                        simple as possible, with a video how-to for every step.
                        Originally written in Python, I converted it to C++ 
                        because it needed to be portable.  The volunteer
                        computer is located inside our local Police Department.

                        <p>
                        I didn't really have an interest in game development at
                        the time, so for the final project in the C++ 
                        Nanodegree program I chose to build a project of my 
                        choice, a spreadsheet parsing tool to help make work 
                        easier for my coworkers in the Kalispell Building 
                        Department.
                        <br><br>
                        The tool parses out building permit information from a 
                        tracking spreadsheet to quickly provide totals for 
                        year end reports. The tool automatically loads and 
                        parses the sheet for the previous calendar year when 
                        run and displays the information to the user. A "Copy"
                        button near each displayed value loads the information 
                        into the operating system clipboard so it can be easily 
                        pasted into a report document with minimal effort 
                        required by the user. This was one of my first projects.

                        A simple system tray/notification area application that 
                        monitors our Cityworks database for newly issued 
                        building permits. Building permit information needs to 
                        be tracked in a spreadsheet as well as mapped in our 
                        GIS, this application streamlines the process by 
                        pulling the data from our Cityworks API, parsing out 
                        what is needed, displaying a validation window for user 
                        verification, then inserting the validated data into the 
                        tracking spreadsheet. The database is checked every 30 
                        minutes for updates, toast notifications inform of work 
                        to be done, clicking the notification triggers data 
                        retrieval and parsing.
                        <br><br>
                        This tool was written to assist in tracking and mapping
                        building permit data, which is part of the daily 
                        workflow in my current role. I had intentions of writing
                        it in C++, but I had just finished a C# course and 
                        wanted to put my newly learned skills to practical use.
                        The UI is a bit strange at first glance - I wanted 
                        something compact that could live in/around the 
                        notification area. I get a popup notification from the 
                        tool when there's a new permit to record. Clicking the
                        notification spawns the validation window, I click a
                        few buttons, maybe enter a text value or two, hit
                        submit, and get back to what I was doing with minimal
                        delay.

                        the workflow in my current role. Development Services 
                        personnel will supply an address, tract id, or assessor
                        number for a land parcel as well as specify a distance 
                        for addresses to include in the mailing list.
                        Previously done manually with GIS software, this tool
                        reduced response time to less than 2 minutes in most
