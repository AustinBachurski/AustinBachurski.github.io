                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                I began my self-taught journey into programming January 2021, 
                starting with C++ and expanding into Python, C#, SQL, C, and 
                JavaScript. This followed a successful 18-year career in the 
                mechanical field, where I spent 4 years as a supervisor and 14
                years as a mechanic. For the last 1.5 years I have been
                applying my problem-solving skills in a GIS role. My goal is
                to transition into a programming career within the next year.
                I still have a lot to learn, but I'm as driven as they come 
                and I've yet to find something I couldn't become good at if 
                I set my mind to it.
                <br><br>
                C++ has been my primary focus as I am drawn to the complexity 
                and control that the language offers. After getting a solid 
                grasp on the fundamentals, I began adding more "tools to the 
                toolbox" starting with Python. My move to a GIS role provided 
                numerous opportunities for automating repatative data entry
                and mapping tasks, and allowed me to learn and work with SQL 
                via our GIS database. I find myself writing at least one simple 
                script each week to make my workflows more efficient. After 
                running into limitations in speed and portability with Python, 
                I returned my focus to C++.  I'll never forget seeing the 
                speed increase for the first time, I thought it didn't work at 
                all because the window closed so fast, then I checked the 
                output file... Pretty sure that is when I got bit by the 
                performance bug, I love making things faster and more efficient.  
                <br><br>
                After acquiring a C++ Nanodegree from Udacity and getting a few 
                projects under my belt, I took several courses in C#, SQL, C, 
                and JavaScript to broaden my skillset and expose me to 
                additional ways of solving problems. My almost two decades of 
                mechanical diagnosis and repair have given me a "can do" 
                attitude and a unique view to problem solving. Vehicles and 
                equipment now a days are pretty much computers with wheels and
                electrical diagnosis was my specialty throughout my previous 
                career, maybe some day I'll pursue a career in embedded systems
                and "return to my roots" in the automotive field.  For now, I
                look forward to learning everything I can about software and 
                systems and honing a new set of skills. It's been a journey 
                already, but I'm just getting started.
                <br> <br>
                My wife and I had our first child, a baby boy, in December of 
                2022, so he takes up most of our free time.  When I do get a 
                chance to get away I enjoy PC gaming, going to see movies with 
                my wife, and weekend barbeques with friends and family.
