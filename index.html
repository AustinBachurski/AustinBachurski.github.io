                    Hi, my name is Austin Bachurski (I've gone by my middle name
                    my whole life) and I began my self-taught journey into
                    programming in January 2021, starting with C++ and Python.
                    This followed a successful 18-year career in the automotive
                    field, where I spent 4 years as a supervisor and 14 years as
                    a mechanic.         
                    <br><br>
                    I've been a geek/nerd most of my life, we got our first
                    computer when I was 11 and I was constantly glued to the
                    thing. Mostly to play Rodent's Revenge... I remember my mom
                    getting me a C++ book when I was an early teen but
                    unfortunately didn't get much past hello world before coming
                    of age to drive and getting interested in cars as a result.
                    This led to the career as a mechanic while being a tech
                    enthusiast, building computers and gaming on the side.
                    <br><br>
                    After turning a wrench for almost 20 years I decided I
                    wanted to do something different and pursue learning
                    programming in that language that I started learning so long
                    ago, C++. Thus, starting my self-taught journey into 
                    learning to code in January of 2021. I bounced around
                    between C++ and Python when I first started learning and I
                    think it's a great way to learn. C++ forces you to
                    understand what's really going on under the hood, where
                    Python makes it easy to get something pretty on the screen.
                    I transferred to a Geographic Information System (GIS) role
                    in July of 2022 to increase my exposure to the tech side of
                    things.  This was a great boon to my learning as it allowed
                    me to put my coding skills to use in a real-world scenario.
                    <br><br>
                    After three and a half years of self-taught learning I
                    finally got hired as a Software Test Engineer this year,
                    albeit part time, but I've learned a lot in the short amount
                    of time I've been doing it. Finally getting exposure to
                    multiple languages at once and using source control with
                    people other than myself feels great. Getting feedback from
                    people with real developer experience has been wonderful and
                    Getting feedback from
                    people with real developer experience has been wonderful and
                    I've been happy to find that I do genuinely enjoy the work
                    and I look forward to a successful career as a developer in
                    the future.

                <b>GIS Specialist</b> 
                - City of Kalispell, MT - IT Department
                (July 2022 - Present)
                <ul>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Developed a Portal Services Controller tool using 
                        C++ and wxWidgets. The tool is used across our 
                        department and makes everyone’s job faster and 
                        easier, moving service control time from a manual 
                        process taking 5 to 10 minutes, to a two-click 
                        automated process requiring less than 2 minutes 
                        to complete.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Developed a command line utility using C++ and an 
                        embedded Python environment to fully automate our 
                        SQL database maintenance. This removed the need for 
                        human intervention other than reading a brief event 
                        log, which is conveniently emailed to GIS staff each 
                        week.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Developed a simple, step-by-step Crime Map Wizard 
                        tool for our Police Department using C++ and 
                        wxWidgets. Eliminating repetitive copy/paste work 
                        which had previously led to frustration and 
                        departure of the volunteers who perform this work.

                        developing a C# tool with a WinForms UI. This tool 
                        calls our Cityworks API to retrieve data and assist 
                        in filtering/inserting the data to a spreadsheet.

                            I wanted to improve my C skills, as well as practice
                            GDB, so I wrote this Tetris clone that runs in the

                            I had a ton of fun and learned a lot as I went
                            through each day. I've been able to complete all

                            two problems stumped me and I had to look at what

                            for the warrant and avoid having to type out a bunch

                            The tool can produce both the Search Warrant Application

                            A simple system tray/notification area application
                            that monitors a database for newly issued building
                            permits.
                            <br><br>
                            This tool was written to assist in tracking and
                            mapping building permit data. The UI is a bit
                            strange at first glance - I wanted something compact
                            that could live in/around the notification area. I
                            get a popup notification from the tool when there's
                            a new permit to record. Clicking the notification 
                            spawns the validation window, just above the task
                            bar that allows the information for the permit to be
                            reviewed at a glance rather than digging through the
                            permit submission to find what I need.

                            Automatically generates a mailing list and

                            Generating mailing lists and maps is something that
                            I previously did manually with GIS software.
                            Automating most of the process allows me to produce
                            the required map and mailing list in less than 2
                            minutes of receiving an emailed request.
