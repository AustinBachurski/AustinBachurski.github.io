                <p>
                I began my self-taught journey into programming in January 2021, 
                starting with C++ and expanding into Python, C#, SQL, C, and 
                JavaScript. This followed a successful 18-year career in the 
                automotive field, where I spent 4 years as a supervisor and 14
                years as a mechanic. For the last 1.5 years I have been
                applying my problem-solving skills in a GIS role. My goal is
                to transition into a programming career within the next year.
                I still have a lot to learn, but I'm as driven as they come 
                and I've yet to find something I couldn't become good at if 
                I set my mind to it.
                <br><br>
                C++ has been my primary focus as I am drawn to the complexity 
                and control that the language offers. After getting a solid 
                grasp on the fundamentals, I began adding more "tools to the 
                toolbox" starting with Python. My move to a GIS role provided 
                numerous opportunities for automating repetitive data entry
                and mapping tasks, and allowed me to learn and work with SQL 
                via our GIS database. I find myself writing at least one simple 
                script each week to make my workflows more efficient. After 
                running into limitations in speed and portability with Python, 
                I returned my focus to C++.  I'll never forget seeing the 
                speed increase for the first time, I thought it didn't work at 
                all because the window closed so fast, then I checked the 
                output file... I'm pretty sure that's when I got bit by the 
                performance bug, I love making things faster and more efficient.  
                <br><br>
                After acquiring a C++ Nanodegree from Udacity and getting a few 
                projects under my belt, I took several courses in C#, SQL, C, 
                and JavaScript to broaden my skillset and expose me to 
                additional ways of solving problems. My almost two decades of 
                mechanical diagnosis and repair have given me a "can do" 
                attitude and a unique view to problem solving. Vehicles and 
                equipment now a days are pretty much computers with wheels and
                electrical diagnosis was my specialty throughout my previous 
                career, maybe some day I'll pursue a career in embedded systems
                and "return to my roots" in the automotive field.  For now, I
                look forward to learning everything I can about software and 
                systems and honing a new set of skills. It's been a journey 
                already, but I'm just getting started.
                <br> <br>
                My wife and I had our first child, a baby boy, in December of 
                2022, so he takes up most of our free time.  When I do get a 
                chance to get away I enjoy PC gaming, going to see movies with 
                my wife, and weekend barbeques with friends and family.

                <ul> <b>GIS Specialist</b> 
                    - City of Kalispell, MT (July 2022 - Present)
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Developed a Portal Services Controller tool using 
                            C++ and wxWidgets. The tool is used across our 
                            department and makes everyoneâ€™s job faster and 
                            easier, moving service control time from a manual 
                            process taking 5 to 10 minutes, to a two-click 
                            automated process requiring less than 2 minutes 
                            to complete.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Developed a command line utility using C++ and an 
                            embedded Python environment to fully automate our 
                            SQL database maintenance. This removed the need for 
                            human intervention other than reading a brief event 
                            log, which is conveniently emailed to GIS staff each 
                            week.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Developed a simple, step-by-step Crime Map Wizard 
                            tool for our Police Department using C++ and 
                            wxWidgets. Eliminating repetitive copy/paste work 
                            which had previously led to frustration and 
                            departure of the volunteers who perform this work.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Automated a large portion of my daily workflow by 
                            developing a C# tool with a WinForms UI. This tool 
                            calls our Cityworks API to retrieve data and assist 
                            in filtering/inserting the data to a spreadsheet.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Wrote another small utility with C++ and wxWidgets 
                            for our Building department that quickly parsed out 
                            annual report data from a spreadsheet instead of 
                            them having to do so manually.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Tailored our Cityworks asset management web 
                            interface and database backend using TypeScript and 
                            XML to suit the needs of our fleet facility as they 
                            migrated to the platform. Migration to Cityworks 
                            allowed the organization to retire the previous 
                            asset management service that was only used for 
                            fleet, saving $900 per year on unneeded subscription 
                            costs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Debugged a large Python script written by a previous 
                            employee that had failed after a network update, 
                            the script was published as a web tool to our GIS 
                            Enterprise portal as a tool, which added a layer of 
                            complexity to troubleshooting.

                            positions for the facility employees. This 
                            initiative provided additional benefits and 
                            compensation incentives to employees who achieved

                            an increase in billable hours of 18% over my 4-year 
                            tenure as supervisor as compared to the 4 years
